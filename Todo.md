	Wed: 
	2. implement a queue using a linked list
	3. implement a stack using a linked list
	4. impelment a stack using a dynamic array

	Thu:
	5. write a linear search algorithm
	6. use a recursion to solve a problem
	7. trace and identify the output of a recursive function call
	8. write a binary search algorithm


[ ] ## 1. Linked Lists

	-> working through singly linked list in ls-datastructures repo
	
	[x] get the test to run
  [ ] pass test on all methods
    [ ] add to tail
    [ ] remove head
    [ ] remove tail

	[ ] then write it over again from memory
